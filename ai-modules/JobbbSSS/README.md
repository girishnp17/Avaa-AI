## 📚 Best Practices & Critical Notes

### ⚖️ Ethical Usage
- **Respect robots.txt and site terms.** This tool is for research and educational use only.
- **Do not use for commercial scraping** without explicit permission from websites.
- **Rate limiting:** Implement delays between requests to avoid overwhelming servers.

### 🔧 Technical Considerations
- **API Rate Limits:** Some job APIs may enforce rate limits or require API keys.
- **Headless Browsing:** Selenium uses headless Chrome; ensure Chrome is installed and up-to-date.
- **Anti-Bot Evasion:** The scraper uses random user agents and stealth options, but sites may still block or throttle scraping.
- **Data Quality:** Job data is parsed heuristically; always validate before use in production.
- **Threading:** Multi-threaded scraping can stress both your system and target sites. Use responsibly.

### 🚨 Important Warnings
- **Legal Compliance:** Ensure compliance with local laws regarding web scraping.
- **Data Privacy:** Be mindful of data protection regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.).
- **Resource Usage:** Large-scale scraping may consume significant CPU and memory.
